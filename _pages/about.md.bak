Hello! I am Ahmed Allam, a postdoctoral associate in the [Signal Kinetics Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/signal-kinetics/overview/) at MIT. I am excited about building ultrasound and acoustic systems that tackle global challenges such as climate monitoring and affordable healthcare.
My work focuses on emerging domains such as low-power underwater and in-body sensing, additive manufacturing, and industry 4.0. It spans: 
* Ultrasonic power and data transfer systems
* Underwater IoT and backscatter communications
* Piezoelectric transducers modeling and design 
* Active and passive acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals
* 3D-printed acoustic materials
* Ultrasonic phased arrays and non-destructive testing (NDT)
* Acoustic testing and automation

## My Bio
I graduated top of my class and completed a BSc and MSc in Mechatronics Engineering from Ain Shams University, Egypt in 2017 and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, USA in 2021. 
I did my Master's in [CVS3](https://dsdc.eng.asu.edu.eg/cvs3-lab) the largest acoustics research center in the middle east under the supervision of [Prof. Wael Akl](https://eas.nu.edu.eg/academic-staff/prof-wael-akl) and [Prof. Adel Elsabbagh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5a0nq7gAAAAJ&hl=en). In my Master's thesis, I developed active acoustic metamaterials whose properties can be programmed electronically from a graphical interface.
I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Alper Erturk](https://www.ssdsl.gatech.edu/) and [Prof. Karim Sabra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=svaTGrwAAAAJ&hl=en) at Georgia Tech. 
During my PhD, 1) I built systems that use ultrasound to transfer power and communicate underwater and through-metals, 2) I built acoustic meta-lenses built using desktop 3D-printers to focus sound underwater and in-air, 3) developed piezoelectric transducers to provide simultaneous power and data for IoT sensors, and 4) developed new techniques to inspect 3D-printed metals using ultrasonic waves.
Currently, I am working with [Prof. Fadel Adib](http://www.mit.edu/~fadel/) at the MIT Media Lab to develop ultr-low-power underwater sensing and communication systems for ocean monitoring and exploration.
