Hi there! I am Ahmed Allam, a postdoctoral fellow in the Smart Structures & Dynamical Systems Lab ([SSDSL](http://www.ssdsl.gatech.edu/)) at Georgia Tech. In my work, I balance theory, simulations, and experiments
in the fields of acoustics and smart materials. My research spans:
* Piezoelectric transducers modeling and design 
* Active and passive acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals
* 3D-printed acoustic materials
* Ultrasonic power and data transfer
* Ultrasonic phased arrays and non-destructive testing (NDT)
* Acoustic testing and automation

I am a mechatronics engineer by training, and I enjoy programming, electronics, and mechanical design. 
I am using this knowledge to communicate with scientists and engineers from different backgrounds, 
to coordinate interdisciplinary work on different levels.
