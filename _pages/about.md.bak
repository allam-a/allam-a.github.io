Hi there! I am Ahmed Allam, a postdoctoral associate in the [Signal Kinetics Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/signal-kinetics/overview/) at MIT. I am passionate about designing, building, and testing ultrasound and acoustic systems that improves the quality of human life and tackles global challenges such as global warming and affordable healthcare.
My work focuses on emerging domains such as low-cost underwater monitoring, additive manufacturing, and ultra-low-power in-body sensing and spans: 
* Ultrasonic power and data transfer systems
* Underwater IoT and backscatter communications
* Piezoelectric transducers modeling and design 
* Active and passive acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals
* 3D-printed acoustic materials
* Ultrasonic phased arrays and non-destructive testing (NDT)
* Acoustic testing and automation
