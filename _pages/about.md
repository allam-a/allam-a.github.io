Hi there! My name is Ahmed Allam, and I am a postdoctoral fellow in the school of mechanical
engineering at Georgia Tech. In my work, I try to balance theory, simulations, and experiments
in the fields of acoustics, vibrations, and smart materials. My research include:
* Active and passive acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals
* Using ultrasonic waves to transfer power and information
* Piezoelectric transducers modeling and design
* Ultrasonic phased arrays and non-destructive testing (NDT)
* Acoustic testing and automation

I am interested in acoustic waves for a broad set of applications: Down from a few Hz in duct networks
and mufflers up to 10s of MHz for ultrasonic imaging and ultrasonic power transfer. 

I come from a mechatronics background, so I have a good grasp of programming, electronics, and mechanical design. 
I try to use this knowledge to communicate with scientists and engineers from different backgrounds, 
which helps me plan and coordinate interdisciplinary work on different levels.
