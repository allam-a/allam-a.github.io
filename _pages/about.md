Hi there! My name is Ahmed Allam, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech. I have recently obtained my PhD in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech, and I am excited to kickstart my career.
I have a lot of experience with modeling and simulation, acoustic testing, automation, and piezoelectric transducers. I love problem solving especially when these problems directly improve the quality of people's life. 

In my work, I try to balance theory, simulations and experiments. I work with analytical models when I want to gain a deeper understanding of the problem, and I go for numerical simulations ( I am good with Comsol) when the problem is 
too complex to solve analytically. I have spent countless hours in the lab doing experiments, so I have become familiar with varios signal generation, amplification and data acquisition hardware. 

I worked with acoustic waves in a broad set of applications: Down from a few Hz in duct networks and mufflers up to 10s of MHz for ultrasonic imaging and ultrasonic power transfer.
I worked with sound in air, so I know a lot about amplifiers, speakers, and microphones, and in metals and water, so I became familiar with pulsers, phased arrays, and hydrophones.
I collected tons of data throughout my masters and PhD, so I became familiar with data acquisition hardware (especially NI), real time controllers (FPGAs), and oscilloscopes. I have used a mix of Matlab 
and LabVIEW to collect and process acoustic data and interface with hardware. I have also worked on converting matlab and LabVIEW data acquisition programs to C when we needed to integrate them in a commercial software ([SIDLAB](https://sidlab.se/)).

I come from a mechatronics background, so I am good with programming, electronics, and mechanical design. This allows me to easily communicate with scientists and engineers from different backgrounds, and helps me plan and coordinate interdisciplinary work on different levels.
