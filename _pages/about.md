Hi there! My name is Ahmed Allam, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech. I have recently obtained my PhD in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech, and I am working on figuring out my next move.
I have a lot of experience with acoustic modeling, testing, and piezoelectric transducers. I love problem solving especially when these problems directly improve the quality of people's life. 

In my work, I try to balance theory, simulations and experiments. I work with analytical models when I want to gain a deeper understanding of the problem, and I go for numerical simulations ( I am good with Comsol) when the problem is 
too complex to solve analytically, or is quicker to solve numerically. I have spent countless hours in the lab doing experiments, so I have become familiar with signal generation and data acquisition hardware. 

I worked with acoustic waves from a few Hz in duct networks and mufflers up to 10s of MHz for ultrasonic imaging and ultrasonic power transfer.
I worked with acoustic waves in air, so I became familiar with amplifiers, speakers, and microphones, and in metals and water, so I became familiar with pulsers, phased arrays, and hydrophones.
I collected tons of data throughout my masters and PhD, so I became familiar with data acquisition hardware (especially NI), real time controllers (FPGAs), and oscilloscopes. I have used a mix of Matlab 
and LabVIEW to collect and process acoustic data and interface with hardware. I have also worked on converting matlab and LabVIEW data acquisition programs to C when we needed to integrate them in a commercial software ([SIDLAB](https://sidlab.se/)).
I really enjoy automating measurements, and can't stand when someone has to stay in a lab for a day doing a measurement that can be automated in an hour, especially if that someone is me.

I come from a mechatronics background, so I am good with programming, electronics, and mechanical design. This allows me to easily communicate with scientists and engineers from different backgrounds, and helps me plan and coordinate interdisciplinary work on different levels.
