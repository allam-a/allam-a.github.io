In this project, we developed a 3D-printed gradient-index phononic crystal based on air inclusions in a polymer 
to manipulate underwater acoustic waves. The proposed approach enables a simple configuration
without heavy inclusions or geometrically complex unit cells to create a refractive-index profile based 
on Luneburg lens. The goal was to focus incident acoustic plane waves propagating in a known direction as shown in the animation below.

Based on the band-structure analysis, we designed, 3D-printed, and tested gradient-index lens yielding an excellent agreement between the
experimental results and finite-element simulations of underwater acoustic wave focusing. The proposed
concept and the resulting lens design can find applications spanning from power enhancement in acoustic
energy transfer and harvesting to signal enhancement in sensing and imaging.
