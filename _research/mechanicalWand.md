In this project, we collaborated with Sandia National Labs to develop a prototype for a charger that uses ultrasonic waves to transfer power through metals. 
Using ultrasonic waves is the only approach to transfer power through metallic walls without introducing any slots that compromises the structural integrity. 
To design a detachable charger, we investigated techniques to transfer ultrasonic waves efficiently from the charger to the metal. The main challenge was to find an alternative to using liquids to fill the microscale gaps between the transducer and the metals since these gaps prevent ultrasonic waves from passing from the transducer to the metal.

We developed a magnetic setup to provide good contact between the charger and the metal wall.
