In this work, we developed a new class of active acoustic metamaterials (AMMs) with a fully controllable effective 
density in realtime. The density of the developed AMM can be programmed to any value ranging from 100 kg/m3 to 100 kg/m3 passing by near zero density
conditions. This is achievable for any frequency between 500 and 1500 Hz. The material consists
of clamped piezoelectric diaphragms with air as the background fluid. The dynamics of the diaphragms
are controlled by connecting a closed feedback control loop between the piezoelectric
layers of the diaphragm (using one piezoelectric layer as a sensor and the other as an actuator). 
The density of the material is adjustable through an outer adaptive feedback
loop that is implemented by the real-time evaluation of the density using the 4-microphone
technique. Applications for the new material include programmable active acoustic filters, nonsymmetric
acoustic transmission, and programmable acoustic superlens.
