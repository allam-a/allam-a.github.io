In this project, we are developing a permanent system for transferring power through 
a metallic system using ultrasonic waves. The system included a bonded transmitter and receiver sending
ultrasonic power through an anodized aluminum wall. An efficient class E power amplifier
was designed to be tightly integrated with the ultrasonic system (mechanical components) with minimal electronic
components. The developed amplifier relied on the ultrasonic system for filtering its output
signal. A complete power transfer system that includes the amplifier, the ultrasonic setup,
and a full bridge rectifier was simulated and then experimentally verified. The system was
able to deliver 17.5W of DC power to a 50 Ohm resistive load at a total DC-to-DC efficiency
of 66%.
