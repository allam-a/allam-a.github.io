Stay tuned for more details about this project where investigate developing piezoelectric
transducers for simultaneous (concurrent) power and data transfer to power and communicate
with sensors and small electronic components placed in inaccessible locations such as
deep in the ocean, inside the human body, and in metallic enclosures. The developed
concept relies on frequency division multiplexing to transmit power and data simultaneously
using a single transducer and without interruption. The sensisitvity and the bandwidth of the
developed transducers are predicted analytically and verified experimentally.
